# Yelp-review-star-rating-prediction-using-review-text
Yelp is a website used for searching local businesses. It provides platform to host reviews for various businesses in form of text and star rating given by users. Work done in this project shows star rating of 1 and 5 are easy to predict from text review alone. It is difficult to predict star rating of 2 and 3 from text review.

Yelp is a website that hosts information for various
types of businesses such as restaurants, shops, salons
etc. Website allows users to provide reviews
for businesses that they have visited or just read
reviews provided by other users. Users providing
reviews can do so in form of either text review or
star rating going from 1 to 5 with 1 meaning their
experience was not so good and 5 being they really
liked the business. Users reading reviews provided
by others can click thumbs up or down for
whether they found the review useful/cool/funny.
Reviews help other users in deciding if they want
to visit the business for their next outing or not.
However, it is not guaranteed as to how many of
these reviews are objective. It becomes necessary
find if the text review and star rating are well correlated
because it is possible that a lot of users want
to quickly refer to just the star rating before deciding
on visiting a business. This can be done
by generating features from review texts and applying
machine learning methods to see how well
we can predict star rating for a review based on
text review. Looking at precision values of these
machine learning methods will allow us to evaluate
efficiency in making these predictions.
